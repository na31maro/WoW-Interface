# Deadly Boss Mods Core

## [8.2.26](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/tree/8.2.26) (2019-11-07)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/compare/8.2.25...8.2.26)

- While at it, add Tasty Morsel carrier notice to Shadhar  
- Fixed Volatile Eruption timers on Shadhar  
    Changed fixate yell option to be on by default on Shadhar (since on mythic player can't move)  
    Added presumed mythic spellId for Cursed Blood to Ilgynoth Reborn, timer for it on mythic will likely be wrong, unless it's same as heroic.  
- Added Ny'alotha instance ID to current content filter for auto logger.  
- Pruned the event sounds feature that allowed playing music during beachhead world quests. Another feature which really didn't need to exist and was not really used by many. A project this large that's maintained by only one person needs to stay within it's scope and going forward DBM will do a better job staying within it's scope.  
- Prune the bonus roll filter feature. it is a feature that requires constant maintenance (that I haven't been doing) and varying opinions on what is considered trivial and non trivial. I feel it's in best interest of project maintainability to remove such an underused poorly maintained fluff feature.  
- Carapace of Nzoth drycode  
- Updated Azeroth module with latest info from 8.3  
- Vexiona update from heroic testing.  
- Updated Xanesh and Hivemind from heroic testing  
- Complete Ilgynoth Reborn mod from heroic testing.  
- More ilgynoth fixes  
- Fix some initial bugs with ilgynoth  
- Only show Nullification blast to the tank tanking caster on Hivemind  
- KR Update (Ny'alotha) (#84)  
    * KR Update (Ny'alotha)  
- hotfix Xanesh with another spellId for void woken  
- Refactored difficulty functions of DBM-Core to allow more precision when needed as well as documented it better.
